# Teil dein Obst

Ever wanted to pick some fruits from trees because you feel like it's a waste to see them rot, or only because they look so yummy?

*Teil dein Obst* is a web app which in the first place helps reducing food waste, especially when it comes to privately owned fruit trees. 
Oftentimes the owners cannot pick and eat all of the fruits, so they just let them rot. 
This web app gives the owner the possiblity to offer their fruits to the community, reducing food waste and helping the environment. 

Think about it. If you buy fruits at the store, the fruits somehow need to get there first, right? Fruits need wrapping, so they don't get damaged during transport, and they need to be cooled as well, which is not really sustainable at all.

This won't be an issue if you can pick fruits yourself e.g. in your neighbourhood or while you're on a walk in nature. But this is only possible if you know you're allowed to pick fruits from *that* tree. This is where *Teil dein Obst* comes in handy. Just open your browser and take a look at the map.

## Deployment
This web app is designed to be a mobile first app.
Get your smartphone and go on **teil-dein-obst.netlify.app** to take a look around.

***NOTE: ALL FRUIT TREES ON THE MAP ARE ONLY MOCK DATA AND NOT REAL! PLEASE REFRAIN FROM GOING TO THE ADDRESS. THANKS.***
